        &lt;p&gt;HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundational protocol that powers the World Wide Web, enabling communication between web browsers and servers. It operates as a request-response protocol where clients (like web browsers) send HTTP requests to servers, which then respond with the requested resources such as HTML pages, images, json, or data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent and doesn&amp;rsquo;t retain information from previous interactions, though mechanisms like cookies and sessions can maintain state when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
