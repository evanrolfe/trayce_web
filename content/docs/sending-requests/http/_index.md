HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundational protocol that powers the World Wide Web, enabling communication between web browsers and servers. It operates as a request-response protocol where clients (like web browsers) send HTTP requests to servers, which then respond with the requested resources such as HTML pages, images, json, or data.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent and doesn't retain information from previous interactions, though mechanisms like cookies and sessions can maintain state when needed.
